The purpose of this assigmment was to utilize mysql-connector-java-5.1.18
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/connector-j.html

We were to connect, insert, and display from a remotely setup sql database
In this given picture example, I had added "Batman Begins"

The picture was the requirement of the submission and not the code. Which I no longer have.
