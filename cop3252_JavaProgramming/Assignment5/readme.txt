The purpose of this assignment was to learn about exceptions



Ok, so the idea here is that we’re attempting to write a program that allows a user to input integer values into a 10-element array and, in addition, will also allow the searching of the array. This program should allow the user to retrieve values from the array by index or by specifying a value to locate. The program should handle any exceptions that might arise when inputting values or accessing array elements. The program should throw a NumberNotFoundException if a particular value cannot be found in the array during a search. If an attempt is made to access an element outside the array bounds, catch the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and display an appropriate error message. Also, the program should throw an Array-IndexOutOfBoundsException if an attempt is made to access an element for which the user has not yet input a value.
