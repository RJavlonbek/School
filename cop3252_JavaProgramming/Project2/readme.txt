The assignment was to create a pseudo java console.


1. At least 3 additional commands should be created inheriting from ActionBase. My console should be able to  run your actions!

2. At least 1 parameter per command, like the -u or -l from my Echo class, in addition to -m which should be reserved for displaying the command's man page.

3. A fully functioning console driver. This should, of course, be completely separate from the actions and WILL NOT inherit from ActionBase.
