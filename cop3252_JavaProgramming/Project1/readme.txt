I saw a comic a long time ago, and thought I would try to implement the idea from the image. I did only for the X
The image is from the webcomic 
http://xkcd.com/832/

I mapped it out in excel for user friendliness, then used that for my program.
Basically it just searches and compares existing board to one of my boards, and when it finds it, it choses the correct spot, the Z signifies the correct spot to choose for the computer, in my excel.

The image and excel are just included as references for you to know how I came up with it, they are not needed to run the program.




There are 1-2 bugs that exist, however I have not been able to make them occur repeatedly enough to track them down.  99% of the time, it runs without issuses. 


I am not super happy with my everything, including the created.jpg, lack of staticistics implemetentation, and the occasional "spaghetti" code. Though I am not entirely sure how to organize it with gui stuff as I am rather new to it. 



Any questions or comments, please let me know!
