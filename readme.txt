These folders contains miscellanous school work by Adam Gorman

The quality of code varies depending upon the particular courses expectation and guidelines on the code, in addition to the general difficulty of the assignment and time available I had. 

They range in difficulty, including some easy and simple assignments.


I personally enjoyed the Android work the most.
