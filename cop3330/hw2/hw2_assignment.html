<em>Finding the mean and median of numerical data</em>
</center>

<P>
<b>Educational Objectives:</b> After successfully completing this assignment,
the student should be able to accomplish the following:
</P>

<ul>
<li>Use a loop structure to read user input of unknown size through <tt>std::cin</tt> and store it in an array.</li>
<li>Use conditional branching to selectively perform computational tasks.</li>
<li>Declare (prototype) and define (implement) functions.</li>
<li>Declare and define functions with arguments of various types, including pointers, references,
const pointers, and const references.</li>
<li>Call functions, making appropriate use of the function arguments and their types.</li>
<li>Make decisions as to appropriate function call parameter type, from among:
value, reference, const reference, pointer, and const pointer.</li>
<li>Compile and run a C++ program in the Unix/Linux environment using <tt>g++</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Operational Objectives:</strong>
Create a project that computes the mean and median of a sequence of
integers received via standard input.
</p>

<p><strong>Deliverables:</strong> 
Four files: <tt>stats.h</tt>, <tt>stats.cpp</tt>, <tt>main.cpp</tt>, <tt>makefile</tt>.
Note that these files constitute a self-contained project.</P>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
Given a finite collection of <i>n</i> numbers:
</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>The  <em>mean</em> is the sum of the numbers divided by <i>n</i>, and</li>
<li>The <em>median</em> is the middle value (in case <i>n</i> is odd) or the
average of the two middle values (in case <i>n</i> is even).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that to find the median of a collection of data, it is convenient to first
<em>sort</em> the data, that is, put the data in increasing (or non-decreasing)
order. Then the median is just the middle datum in the sorted sequence (or the
average of the two middle data, if there are an even number).
</p>

<p> One of the simplest sort algorithms is called <em>Selection Sort</em>, which operates
on an array of elements and has a computation which
can be described in one sentence: <i>For each element of the
array, find the smallest element with equal or higher index in the array and swap these two
elements.</i> Here is a "pseudocode" description of the algorithm:
</p>  
<blockquote><pre>
for i in [0...n)       // for each element of array A
  k = i                // find the smallest element following it
  for j in [i+1...n)
    if A[j] < A[k]
      k = j
    endif
  endfor               // now A[k] is the smallest element following A[i]
  swap the values in A[i] and A[k]
endfor
</pre></blockquote><p>

(You could test whether <tt>A[k] < A[i]</tt> before the swap, but it is not clear
this would speed up the process - swapping may be faster than testing.)
</p>

<h2>Procedural Requirements:</h2>

<ol type="1">

<li><p> Create and work within a
separate subdirectory <tt>cop3330/hw2</tt>. 
Review the COP 3330 rules found in Introduction/Work Rules. 
</p></li>

<li><p>
Copy these files
</p><blockquote><pre>
LIB/hw2/makefile
LIB/hw2/hw2submit.sh
</pre></blockquote><p>
from the course distribution library into your project directory.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Create three more files
</p><blockquote><pre>
stats.h
stats.cpp
main.cpp
</pre></blockquote><p>
complying with the Technical Requirements and Specifications stated below.
</p></li>


<li><p>
Turn in four files <tt>stats.h</tt>, <tt>stats.cpp</tt>, <tt>main.cpp</tt>,
and <tt>makefile</tt> using the <tt>hw2submit.sh</tt> submit script.
</p>
<p>
<em><b>Warning:</b> Submit scripts do not work on the <tt>program</tt> and
<tt>linprog</tt> servers. Use <tt>shell.cs.fsu.edu</tt> to submit projects. If you do
not receive the second confirmation with the contents of your project, there has
been a malfunction.</em>
</p></li>

</ol>

<h2>Technical Requirements and Specifications</h2>
<ol>

<li><p>
The project should compile error- and warning-free on <tt>linprog</tt> with the command
<tt>make stats.x</tt>.
</p></li>

<li><p> The number of integers input by the user is not known in advance, except
that it will not exceed 100. Numbers are input through standard input, either
from keyboard or file re-direct. The program should read numbers until a
non-digit or end-of-file is encountered or 100 numbers have been read.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Once the input numbers have been read, the program should calculate the mean and
median and then report these values to standard output. 
</p></li>

<li><p>
The source code should be structured as follows:
<ol type="a">
<li>Implement separate functions with the following prototypes:
<pre>float Mean   (const int* array, size_t size); // calculates mean of data in array
float Median (int* array, size_t size);       // calculates median of data in array
void  Swap   (int& x, int& y);                // interchanges values of x and y
void  Sort   (int* array, size_t size);       // sorts the data in array
</pre>
</li>

<li>I/O is handled by function <tt>main()</tt>; no other functions should do any
I/O</li>
<li>Function <tt>main()</tt> calls <tt>Mean()</tt> and <tt>Median()</tt></li>
<li>Function <tt>Median()</tt> calls <tt>Sort()</tt></li>
<li>Function <tt>Sort()</tt> calls <tt>Swap()</tt></li>
</ol>
</p></li>

<li><p>
The source code should be organized as follows:
<ol type="a">
<li>Prototypes for <tt>Mean</tt>, <tt>Median</tt>, <tt>Sort</tt>, and
<tt>Swap</tt> should be in file <tt>stats.h</tt></li>
<li>Implementations for <tt>Mean</tt>, <tt>Median</tt>, <tt>Sort</tt>, and
<tt>Swap</tt> should be in file <tt>stats.cpp</tt></li>
<li>Function <tt>main</tt> should be in file <tt>main.cpp</tt></li>
</ol>
</p></li>

<li><p>
The <tt>Sort()</tt> function should implement the Selection Sort
algorithm.
</li></p>

<li><p>
When in doubt, your program should behave like the distributed executable
examples in <tt>stats_i.x</tt> and <tt>stats_s.x</tt> in <tt>area51</tt>. Identical behavior is not required, but the
general I/O behavior should be the same. In particular, the data input loop
should not be interupted by prompts for a next datum - this will make file
redirect cumbersome. Just ask for the data one time, then read until a non-digit
or end of file is encountered.
</li></p>

</ol>

<h2>Hints</h2>

<ul>

<li>
Sample executables are distributed in <tt>[LIB]/area51</tt>. These are named
<tt>stats_i.x</tt> and <tt>stats_s.x</tt>. The suffixes indicate which of the
two architectures the executable is compiled on: <tt>*_i.x</tt> runs on
Intel/Linux and <tt>*_s.x</tt> runs on Sun/Unix. 
</li>

<li>
To run a sample executable, follow these steps: (1) Decide which architecture
you want to use. The <tt>program</tt> machines are 32-bit Sun architecture running
Sun's version of Unix, and the <tt>linprog</tt> machines are Intel 64-bit
architecture running Linux. (2) Copy the appropriate executable into your space
where you want to run it. For example, if you are logged in to <tt>program</tt>
enter the command "<tt>cp [LIB]/area51/stats_s.x .</tt>". (3) Change permissions
to executable: "<tt>chmod 700 stats_s.x</tt>". (4) Execute by entering the name
of the executable. If you want to run it on a data file "<tt>data1</tt>", use
input redirect as in: "<tt>stats_s.x < data1</tt>". If you want the output to go to
another file, use output redirect: "<tt>stats_s.x < data1 > data1.out</tt>".
</li>

<li>
Two test files are distributed in <tt>[LIB]/hw2</tt>.
To run the sample executable on a file, say <tt>data1</tt>, first make sure you
have an executable copy of the program and the data file, then enter the
command:<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stats.x &lt; data1</tt><br>
This is a Unix/Linux operation that redirects the contents of <tt>data1</tt>
into standard input for <tt>stats.x</tt>. Using &gt; redirects program output. For
example, the command:<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stats.x &lt; data1 > data1.out</tt><br>
sends the contents of <tt>data1</tt> to standard input and then sends the
program output into the file <tt>data1.out</tt>. These are very handy operations
for testing programs.
</li>

<li>
It is sometimes simpler to develop the code in a single file (such as
<tt>project.cpp</tt>) that can be edited in one window and test-compiled with a
single command (such as <tt>g++&nbsp;-Wall&nbsp;-Wextra&nbsp;-ostats.x&nbsp;project.cpp</tt>) and
split the file up into the deliverables after the initial round of testing and
debugging. </li>

<li>
Note that the array in which input is stored is passed to the functions as a
pointer. In the case of <tt>Mean()</tt>, this pointer is <tt>const</tt>,
indicating that the elements of the array may not be changed by the
call. However in the case of <tt>Median()</tt>, the array element values are
allowed to change. These values are in fact changed by the call to
<tt>Sort()</tt>.
</li>

<li>The function <tt>Sort()</tt> operates on the array input as a pointer. When
the function returns, the values of the array should be in increasing order.</li>

<li>The selection sort algorithm requires a nested pair of <tt>for</tt> loops
(one inside the other).</li>

<li>The function <tt>Swap()</tt> encapsulates the chore of swapping two values.
Your sort implementation should call <tt>Swap</tt> whever two values need to
be swapped. Note that the two parameters for <tt>Swap</tt> are passed by
reference, so that the function acts on the values in the <i>calling</i>
routine.
</li>

<li>Sorting the data is essential to calculate the median: when in an array that
is sorted, the middle (two) values are those contained in the middle (two) indices
of the array. </li>

<li>
The middle index
of an array of <tt>n</tt> elements, when <tt>n</tt> is odd, is
[(<tt>n-1)/2]</tt>. The middle two indices, when <tt>n</tt> is even, are
<tt>[n/2 - 1]</tt> and <tt>[n/2]</tt>.
</li>

<li>Be careful when subtracting 1 from an unsigned integer type such as <tt>size_t</tt>.</li>

<li>Look at the code examples in <a
href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~lacher/courses/COP3330/lectures/control/toc.html" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a> of the lecture notes to find simple
ways to structure your main I/O loop.</li>
